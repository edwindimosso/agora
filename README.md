It leverages Django’s core strengths, including a Custom User Model, CRUD operations, and Complex Queries for an advanced search system. Key features include category-based threading, a live-chat feel for specific topics via WebSockets, and a robust Admin/Moderator dashboard. This project showcases a complete MVT architecture integrated with scalable database relationships to handle high volumes of user-generated content.
